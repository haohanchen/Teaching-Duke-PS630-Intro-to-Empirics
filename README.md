## Lab Handouts and Code for POLSCI630 Probability and Regression (Fall 2018)

*Haohan Chen*

[Lab 1 R Basics](../../tree/master/01-R-Basics-Data-Exploration): Create your first R program. Download data from an R wrapper of World Bank API.

[Lab 2 Random Variables and Data Structure](../../tree/master/02-Random-Variable-R-Data-Structure): Understand properties of random variables by R simulation.

[Lab 5 Introduction to Rmarkdown](../../tree/master/05-Intro-to-Rmarkdown): My favorite tool for reproducible research (a possible substitute for LaTeX), demonstrated with a case.

[Lab 5 (2) Data Management with R](../../tree/master/05-R-Data-Management): Data cleaning with R using `dplyr`, `tidyr`.

[Lab 8 Interaction Effect](../../tree/master/08-Interaction-Effect): What is an interaction effect? How to interpret it? How to visualize it? (Probabily THE most important knowledge to learn for quantitative political science studies using observational or experimental data)

[Lab 9 Regression Discontinuity](../../tree/master/09-Regression-Discontinuity): A popular model for causal identification, demonstrated with a classic example

[Homeworks](../../tree/master/Homeworks): Maths + some mini-projects with real data.
